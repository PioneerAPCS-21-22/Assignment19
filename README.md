# Assignment 19

## Part 1

Given a string, check to see if it contains an 'x' and remove it if it does. Assume there will be at most one 'x' in the string and do not use any loops, just string methods you have learned.

### Sample Outputs

```
removeX("exit") → "eit"
removeX("hello") → "hello"
removeX("x") → ""
removeX("") → ""
```

## Part 2

Given two strings, return a single String (by using concatenation) with the two Strings in alphabetical order, with a space separating them.

### Sample Outputs

```
ordered("hello", "apple") → "apple hello"
ordered("badabing", "badaboom") → "badabing badaboom"
ordered("Hello", "apple") → "Hello apple"
```

### Grading

As always, your program will be graded on its functionality according to the project specifications and proper code style.
